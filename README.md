# Tommytale Dice Discord Bot!
This is a discord bot made for the Tommytale campagin (and Out of The Abyss now too) but maybe useful to others! With this bot you will be able to generate custom dice rolls directly in the discord server you are playing on! Maybe doing an online D&D campaign! (Like us right now)

# Installation
Simply clone the repo wherever you like and create an app ad a bot on the discord developer panel! When you created the bot on discord dev panel paste the bot token in the TOKEN varible in the first part of the bot.py file. When you are ready, just execute the file bot.py and you are done.

# How to use
When you added the bot your discord server simply type !d<number of the dice you want to roll> and you'll have a nice image with the die! There is however an exception, the d100 or percentual dice, that is represented by % so, !d% for it! Also, using !dsimple you can switch off the images in favor of simple embedded text.
 
 # Example usage:
 !d10
 (prentending to be an img for now): 9
